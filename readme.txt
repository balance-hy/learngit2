mkdir "directoryname"
cd "directoryname"
git init

create a file i.e example.txt
put this file in the "directoryname"(or subdirectories of this directory)

git add example.txt
git commit -m "something you want say"

Why do we need add and commit instead of just add?
because commit can commit many files so you can add different files many times.

ls:View all files in the current directory.
